## Instructions
For local development, run `npm install` on the main directory and then `gulp` to get BrowserSync going along with all the Gulp tasks (see [Pear](https://github.com/jrdnbwmn/Pear)).

Development files are in `src`. Everything is compiled into `dist`—that’s where all your final files reside.
